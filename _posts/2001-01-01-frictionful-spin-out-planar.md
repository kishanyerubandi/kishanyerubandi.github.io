If an object is on a disk (but away from the center) and the disk starts spinning sufficiently fast so that the static friction can no longer keep the object at rest relative to the disk, what is the precise shape of the "spiral" path the object will trace as it "spins out"? Testing tex: $\alpha=\beta$.
